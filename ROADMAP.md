# Realm: The Ultimate Developer Experience

## The Grand Vision

**Realm is a self-organizing, P2P compute mesh that eliminates traditional CI/CD infrastructure and replaces centralized cloud orchestration with a distributed, owner-controlled network.**

### The Problem We're Solving

Current developer infrastructure is broken:
- **CI/CD Hell**: Complex pipelines, brittle dependencies, vendor lock-in
- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Kubernetes, Docker registries, cloud vendor APIs
- **Operational Overhead**: Managing control planes, agents, authentication, networking
- **Cost & Vendor Lock-in**: Expensive cloud services with proprietary APIs
- **Geographic Limitations**: Centralized deployment, poor edge support

### The Realm Solution

Instead of this nightmare:
```
Developer → GitHub → CI/CD → Docker Registry → Kubernetes → AWS → Prayer
```

You get this:
```
Developer → realm submit job.toml → Done
```

**Core Principles:**
1. **Zero Infrastructure**: No control planes, no registries, no cloud dependencies
2. **Owner-Controlled**: Your mesh, your rules, your data
3. **Deterministic & Predictable**: Strong isolation, verifiable deployments
4. **Universal**: Any hardware, any OS, any architecture
5. **Self-Organizing**: Nodes discover each other and coordinate automatically

### What Realm Enables

#### **Immediate Benefits**
- Deploy WASM components across your entire fleet with one command
- Manage distributed infrastructure from any node via web interface
- Upgrade agents across multiple architectures with zero downtime
- Real-time monitoring and logging without external services

#### **The Ultimate Experience**
```bash
# Replace entire CI/CD pipeline
realm job submit build-and-test.toml

# Deploy globally in seconds
realm deploy web-app.realm

# Run distributed workloads
realm job submit train-model.toml --gpu-required

# Upgrade entire fleet
realm upgrade --all-platforms ./new-agent
```

#### **Revolutionary Capabilities**
- **Multi-Runtime Execution**: WASM, native binaries, containers, VMs, QEMU emulation
- **Content-Addressed Storage**: Automatic deduplication and caching across the mesh
- **Job Orchestration**: One-off tasks, scheduled jobs, persistent services

- Clear visibility into upgrade status across the mesh

### **Phase 2: Universal Job Orchestration**
**Goal:** Submit and execute arbitrary workloads across the mesh, replacing traditional CI/CD.

#### Job Definition Schema:
```toml
[job]
name = "build-my-app"
type = "one-shot"  # or "recurring", "service"
schedule = "0 2 * * *"  # for recurring jobs

[runtime]
type = "wasm"  # or "native", "container", "qemu"
image = "rust:latest"  # for containers
binary = "./my-app"    # for native
memory_mb = 1024
cpu_cores = 2

[execution]
command = ["cargo", "build", "--release"]
working_dir = "/src"
timeout_minutes = 30

[targeting]
platform = "linux/amd64"  # or "any"
tags = ["builder", "rust"]  # target nodes with these tags
node_ids = []  # or specific nodes

[data]
inputs = [
    { git = "github.com/user/repo", ref = "main", mount = "/src" },
    { asset = "large-dataset", mount = "/data" }

### **Phase 3: Component Packaging & Asset Distribution**
**Goal:** Deploy complete applications (WASM + static assets) with verifiable integrity and clear data lifecycle semantics.

#### Package Format (`.realm`):
```
my-app.realm/
├── manifest.toml     # Package metadata, file hashes, and mount specifications
├── component.wasm    # Main WASM component
├── static/           # Static assets (RO, content-addressed, swappable)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── app.js
│   └── styles.css
├── config/           # Initial configuration (RO, from package)
│   └── app.conf
└── seed-data/        # Optional seed data for persistent volumes
    └── initial.db
```

#### Data Lifecycle Categories:
1. **Static Assets** (read-only, content-addressed, swappable on upgrades)
2. **Working State** (ephemeral, read-write, cleared between restarts)  
3. **Long-term State** (persistent, read-write, never touched automatically)

#### Package Manifest Example:
```toml
[component]
name = "my-web-app"
wasm = "component.wasm"
sha256 = "abc123..."

[[mounts]]
kind = "static"           # RO, from package, content-addressed
guest = "/www"
source = "static/"        # Path within package

[[mounts]]  
kind = "config"           # RO, from package, for initial configuration
guest = "/etc/app"
source = "config/"

[[mounts]]
kind = "work"             # RW, ephemeral, per-replica
guest = "/tmp"
size_mb = 100            # Optional limit

[[mounts]]
kind = "state"            # RW, persistent, across restarts/upgrades  
guest = "/data"
volume = "app-data"       # Named volume or "default"
seed = "seed-data/"       # Optional: copy from package on first install only
```

#### Agent Directory Structure:
```
agent_data_dir()/
├── artifacts/
│   └── packages/               # Content-addressed package storage
│       └── {digest}/           # Extracted package contents
│           ├── component.wasm
│           ├── static/
│           ├── config/
│           └── seed-data/
├── work/
│   └── components/             # Ephemeral working directories
│       └── {name}/
│           └── {replica-id}/   # Per-replica isolation
├── state/
│   └── components/             # Persistent state volumes
│       └── {name}/             # Component persistent data
└── jobs/                       # Job-specific storage
```

#### Tasks:
1. **Package Creation** (`crates/agent/src/cmd/package.rs`)
   ```bash

   # Creates my-web-app.realm with embedded manifest
   ```

2. **Bundle Schema** (`crates/common/src/lib.rs`)
   - `PackageManifest` with file inventory, SHA256 hashes, and mount specifications
   - `MountSpec` extensions for mount kinds: `static`, `work`, `state`
   - Volume lifecycle management and seeding semantics

3. **Deploy Enhancement** (`crates/agent/src/cmd/push.rs`)
   ```bash
   realm deploy my-app.realm --tag production
   ```

4. **Agent Package Handling** (`crates/agent/src/supervisor.rs`, `crates/agent/src/runner.rs`)
   - Extract and verify package integrity with SHA256 validation
   - Content-addressed storage for packages: `artifacts/packages/{digest}/`
   - Mount provisioning with lifecycle guarantees:
     - Static: Package assets mounted RO, swapped atomically on upgrades
     - Work: Ephemeral per-replica directories, cleaned up on restart/scale-down  
     - State: Persistent volumes with optional one-time seeding from package
   - Volume management and cleanup automation

5. **Web UI Package Support**
